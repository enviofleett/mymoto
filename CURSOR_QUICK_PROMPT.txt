Fix and test realtime vehicle location updates on the vehicle profile page.

STEPS:

1. Apply database fix in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE vehicle_positions;
   ALTER TABLE vehicle_positions REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;

2. Verify fix worked:
   SELECT tablename FROM pg_publication_tables WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime' AND tablename = 'vehicle_positions';
   (Should return 1 row)

3. Test in browser:
   - Navigate to /owner/vehicle/:deviceId (singular "vehicle")
   - Open console (F12)
   - Look for: "[Realtime] ✅ Successfully subscribed to vehicle_positions updates for [deviceId]"
   - Wait 60s for GPS sync OR manually update DB:
     UPDATE vehicle_positions SET latitude = latitude + 0.0001 WHERE device_id = 'YOUR_ID';
   - Verify console shows: "[Realtime] Position update received for [deviceId]:"
   - Verify console shows: "[Realtime] ✅ Cache updated and invalidated"
   - Verify map updates instantly without refresh

Expected: Map marker moves in < 1 second when database updates. No page refresh needed.

I will fix the data discrepancy for vehicle **RBC784CX** by resetting its trip data and forcing a fresh synchronization with GPS51.

### **The Problem**
*   **Corrupted History**: The `vehicle_trips` table likely contains "ghost trips" generated by the old estimation logic before my recent fix.
*   **Duplicate/Bad Data**: These old records are mixing with the new, correct GPS51 data, causing the "contradicting mileage" and incorrect trip count (showing more than the actual 4 trips).

### **The Fix**
1.  **Database Cleanup**: I will create and apply a migration to:
    *   **Delete all existing trips** for vehicle `RBC784CX` from the `vehicle_trips` table.
    *   **Reset the sync status** for this vehicle in `trip_sync_status`.
2.  **Force Fresh Sync**: Resetting the sync status will cause the system to treat the next sync as a "first run," triggering a clean fetch of the authentic trips from GPS51 for the last 24 hours (which covers the trips shown in your screenshot).

### **Execution Steps**
1.  Create migration `supabase/migrations/20260130150000_reset_rbc784cx_data.sql`.
2.  Execute `npx supabase db push` to apply the cleanup.
3.  **Action for You**: After I finish, please click the **"Refresh"** button on the Vehicle Profile page. This will trigger the fresh sync and populate the correct 4 trips.

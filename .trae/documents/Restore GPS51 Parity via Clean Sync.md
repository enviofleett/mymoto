I will restore the system to use the direct GPS51 synchronization method, which is the only way to achieve 100% parity with the platform's trip reports. The previous issues ("ghost trips" and "contradicting mileage") were caused by a mix of old calculated data and frontend estimation logic, both of which I will now permanently resolve.

### **The Solution**
1.  **Backend Restoration**: Re-apply the migration to make `get_vehicle_trips_optimized` query the authoritative `vehicle_trips` table instead of calculating approximations.
2.  **Frontend Fix**: Remove the "mileage guessing" logic from `useVehicleProfile.ts` to ensure the dashboard displays exactly what is in the database (which comes from GPS51).
3.  **Data Synchronization**: Trigger a clean sync for **RBC784CX**. Since I previously wiped the corrupted data, this fresh sync will fetch exactly the 4 trips you listed from GPS51.

### **Why This Will Fix It**
*   **Trip 1, 2, 3, 4**: These specific start/end times and mileages are generated by GPS51's proprietary algorithm. Our dynamic calculation (the "8am state") cannot replicate this perfectly.
*   **Syncing is the Key**: By syncing the *result* of GPS51's algorithm directly into our table, we guarantee that our dashboard shows the exact same numbers.

### **Execution Steps**
1.  **Re-apply Backend Migration**: Switch `get_vehicle_trips_optimized` back to "Table Mode".
2.  **Update Frontend**: Remove distance estimation code.
3.  **Trigger Sync**: I will manually trigger the `sync-trips-incremental` function for this device to populate the 4 missing trips immediately.
